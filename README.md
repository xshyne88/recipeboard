# Recipeboard

This project was written in Elixir using a Phoenix backend with GraphQL and PostgreSQL.
The idea of this project is that a content creator can write menu for people to subscribe to week after week.
This project is in its very early stages and serves as a template for Elixir/Phoenix/PostgreSQL projects.
